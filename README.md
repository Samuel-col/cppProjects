# C++ Projects

## Description

Here you can find several cpp projects i've done while im learning this programming language. The course that i am taking is called Programming and Numerical Methods, so its is oriented to math topics, however there are some scripts as ```tali.cpp``` that have nothing to do with my course.

## List of Scripts

* tali: Is a dice game that i copied from [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) Games. 
* LinAlg: Contains several linear algebra matrix functions as determinant, inverse matrix and it solves linear equations systems.
* bases: Its a simple script that converts numbers from one base to another.
* cribae: Prints the first n prime numbers using Eratostenes Cribe.
* ficheros: Read and write text files.
* interLag: Estimates functions values by using Lagrange Interpolation.
* raices: Compares three common roots finders.
* antiPri: Finds the first positive integer whose number of divisors is grater or equal that a certain value.
* compare: Compares two files in order to find if they have the same content or if they hava some difference.
